## ⚠️ Important Notice: Pipeline Refactoring

**This repository has been refactored to remove verl and vllm dependencies.**

### What Was Removed

This refactoring removed the heavy RL training infrastructure to create a minimal pipeline:

1. **Removed the verl framework** - The entire `AgentGym-RL/verl` directory containing:
   - Ray-based distributed training components
   - PPO, GRPO, RLOO, and other RL algorithms
   - vLLM integration for rollouts
   - FSDP and Megatron workers

## 🌟 Overview

Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent decisioiins to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Merely relying on human demonstration for behaviour cloning can make agents competent for tasks, but rarely leads to genuine breakthoughs. As Richard Sutton emphasizes, it is the knowledge, skills and experience acquired through exploration and interaction with the environment that truly drives agents forward. Therefore, a promising approach is to train these agents using Reinforcement Learning.

Most existing studies remain limited to single-turn tasks like math and coding. Recent attempts to extend RL to train LLM agents with multi-turn capabilities face notable challenges:

- **Restricted task complexity and environment diversity.** In the era of reinforcement learining, environments have become increasingly crucial. Agents that perform well only in toy settings struggle to transfer to real-world scenarios, while diversity in environments is a prerequisite for their generalization. 
- **Difficulties in achieving stable and efficient** **optimization**. Multi-turn interaction dramatically enlarges the search space and increases variance in training signals, making it challenging to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. 

To address these challenges, we introduce **AgentGym-RL**, a new framework to train LLM agents for **multi-turn** interactive decision-making through RL. It encompasses a wide variety of **real-world scenarios** and supports mainstream RL algorithms, establishing a foundation for the research and practice **in the era of experience**.

Furthermore, to tackle the exploration–exploitation trade-off and improve optimization stability in agent RL training, we propose **ScalingInter-RL**, a method that progressively extends the agent–environment interaction horizon during training. Experiments across different environments show that leveraging our AgentGym-RL framework with the ScalingInter-RL algorithm yields stable, sustained and substantial behavioral improvement.

In addition, to facilitate probing of data and model behaviors, we provide an **visualized interactive** **user interface** that allows for the replay and examination of full interaction trajectories, thereby streamlining empirical analysis for iterative development.

## Features

### Modular System Design of AgentGym-RL

We adopt a modular and decoupled design to implement AgentGym-RL, organizing it into three main components:

- **Environment** **module**: provides diverse scenarios via a standardized server–client architecture with unified HTTP protocols and parallel requests.
- **Agent module**: encapsulates the reasoning and decision-making process of agents in multi-turn interactions, with support for advanced mechanisms such as long-horizon planning and self-reflection. 
- **Training module**: implements reinforcement learning pipelines and other training methods to optimize agent policies. 

![](./assets/pseudo.jpg)

### Environments

* **Web Navigation**: We include **WebArena**, a realistic and reproducible web environment containing 4 distinct domains prevalent on the internet: online shopping, discussioin forums, collaborative development, and bussiness contnt management.
* **Deep Search**: Building upon **Search-R1**, we include a RAG-based environment which enables LLMs to interact with search engines and solve multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks.
* **Digital Games**: We include **TextCraft**, a text-based crafting game environment in which agents complete tasks via natural language interactions and task-based planning.
* **Embodied Tasks**: We include **BabyAI** which provides a controllable grid world with text instructions for embodied reasoning in simulated environments.
* **Scientific Tasks**: We include **SciWorld** which offers a scientific exploration simulator where agents conduct scientific experimemts through text-driven reasoning cycles. 

### Post-Training Strategies

AgentGym-RL supports a suite of mainstream online RL algorithms: **PPO, GRPO, RLOO, REINFORCE++.**

Beyond online RL, AgentGym-RL also supports a broad range of complementary training paradigms: **SFT, DPO, AgentEvol.**

### ScalingInter-RL: Progressive Scaling Interaction for Agent RL

ScalingInter-RL is a training approach designed to balance exploration and exploitation while ensuring stable optimization. At its core is a **progressive horizon-scaling strategy** that adaptively adjusts the number of interaction turns during RL.

![](./assets/ScalingInter-RL-Method.png)

We start training with a smaller horizon, allowing the agent to efficiently exploits its policy and gain early proficiency on simple tasks. This establishes  the groundwork for deeper, long-horizon reasoning.  As training progresses, we gradually extend the horizon, enabling the agent to explore longer decision paths and fostering the emergence of higher-order cognitive behaviors.

### Pipeline Refactoring

**Note:** This repository has been refactored to remove verl and vllm dependencies. The training pipeline has been minimized to focus on core utilities.

**What was removed:**
- The entire verl RL training framework
- vllm integration and dependencies
- Ray-based distributed training components
- Complex RL algorithms (PPO, GRPO, RLOO, etc.)

**What remains:**
- Core utilities and dataset handling
- Documentation for reference
- AgentGym integration

For the original full-featured version with complete RL training capabilities, please refer to the original verl repository.

### Extending Verl (Historical Reference)

We make following modifications to verl in order to develop AgentGym-RL:

1. **Rollout using vllm engine**: To support multi-turn rollouts and efficent interaction with the environment, we introduce:

   * RolloutHandler to handle trajectories. We introduce `RolloutHandler` to correctly compute the attention masks, loss masks, position ids and sequence ids for environment observations and assistant's actions in each turn. It also handles historical messages, status and reward.

   * EnvClient to handle interactions. The `EnvClient` provides several methods to facilitates interactions with the environment during rollout, such as observarion() to get the currect observation from the environment, available_actions() to get the currectly available actions, step() to perform an action, and reset() to reset the environmet. To improve efficiency, our framework initializes environments and collects trajectories in parallel.

2. **Advantage computation**: We revise verl's implementation of advantage computation for REINFORCE++ and GAE to ensure correctness in both single-turn and multi-turn scenarios.

3. **Scaling interaction during training**: To develop ScalingInter-RL, we introduce `RoundScheduler` to scale interactions during training. The `FixedRoundsScheduler` enforces a fixed maximum number of interactions. The `StepRoundsScheduler` gradually increases the interaction horizon in a step-wise manner, enabling progressive scaling during training.

## Performance

We leverage Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B as our primary backbone models. We evaludate AgentGym-RL and ScalingInter-RL across **five scenarios** and include multiple closed-source models and open-source models for comparison. The evaluation results on WebArena benchmark are as follows, while results on other benchmarks can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08755).

![](./assets/webarena_performance.png)

- The **ScalingInter-7B** model significantly **surpasses top-tier proprietary models** like GPT-4o, and **performs on par with larger models** like DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Gemini-2.5-Pro. Moreover, in Shopping and CMS, the achieved score matches the best performance among all models in these categories.
- The **AgentGym-RL-7B** achieved an overall score that **matches the performance of GPT-4o**.

Moreover, ScalingInter-RL demonstrates more **stable and effcient** training dynamics during RL optimization as shown in the figure below. 

![](./assets/searchqa_performance.jpg)

* Longer-turn settings initially achieve higher rewards by enabling richer exploration but rapidly collapse; Shorter-turns yield more stable but less exploratory learning, leading to a performance ceilling. 
* Our ScalingInter-RL method **progressively increases the interaction horizon**, and ultimately achieves **higher and more efficient** long-term performance.
